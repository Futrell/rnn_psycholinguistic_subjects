# NPIs and distractors in English

- Experimental setup and predictions following Parker & Collins (2016)

Design: 2x2x2:
- Presence of initial grammatical licensor (major effect)
- Presence of irrelevant licensor (minor effect)
- NPI Item (ever / any) (minor effect: with irrelevant licensor any should show higher surprisal, with no licensors, should show lower surprisal).

Predictions
- Surprisal at NPI is higher with no grammatical licensor (major effect)
- Surprisal at NPI is higher without presence of irrelevant licensor (minor effect)
- Surprisal with ANY is higher than EVER with irrelevant licensor (minor effect)
- Surprisal with EVER is higher than ANY with no licensors (minor effect)
